## 🌱 Introduction  

Hey everyone! 👋  
I’m Aditya Sharma, and over the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into the world of **Machine Learning** — from cleaning data and visualizing patterns to building my first neural network.  

This post is a summary of what I’ve learned, how my mindset evolved, and where I’m headed next.

## 🧩 Where It All Started  

I began my journey with the basics: **understanding data**.  
I learned how to handle missing values using `dropna()`, visualize trends using `matplotlib`, and normalize datasets with scaling techniques.  

It wasn’t just about running code — I wanted to *understand what happens behind every line*.

## 📊 Building My Foundation  

### 🔹 Data Visualization
- Learned to use `plt.scatter()` and `plt.plot()` to visualize data patterns.  
- Explored `plt.hist()` with `bins` and `density=True` — realizing that when `density=True`, the total area under the histogram equals **1**, representing a probability distribution.  

> Visualization taught me that good models start with *good understanding* of data.

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Splitting
- Learned how `dropna()` helps remove missing values.  
- Used `train_test_split()` to divide data into train/test sets, and even discovered a NumPy trick to create a **3-way split** (train/validation/test) in one line:
  ```python
  train, valid, test = np.split(df.sample(frac=1), [int(0.6*len(df)), int(0.8*len(df))])
